            </h1>
            <p class="texto.normal">I am a young graduate in radiation therapy and biomedical engineering, equipped with both clinical and business experience. I am an adventurous individual who thrives on utilizing technology to solve problems. Combining my technical skills with a genuine passion for in teracting with people, I find fulfillment in roles that allow me to apply my expertise to help others.
                <br>
                Beyond my work, I am an avid enthusiast of fitness and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Reading books enables me to explore fresh ideas and gain new perspectives and traveling is one of my greatest passions, as both provide the opportunity to embrace diverse cultures and broaden my horizons. 
                <br>
                Lately, I have developed a curiosity for stock markets and web development, and I am casually studying these subjects to expand my knowledge and unearth potential opportunities.</p>
